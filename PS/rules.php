$title = "Pokemon Perfect Showdown Server Rules";
$content = "\t\t\t<p><b><i>The following rules all pertain to the Pokemon Showdown server, i.e. challenging, battling and sending messages in the server. All rules that include sending messages, apply to private, main chat and battle messaging unless one or more of those is specifically referenced. Please alert a server auth if no immediate punitive response is taking place in a situation you feel it should. This does not apply to disputes that are out of the scope of the server rules and/or are centered around private messages unavailable firsthand.</i></b></p>\n"
. "\t\t\t<p><b>1. No mini-moderation:</b><br />\n"
. "\t\t\tNo attempting to moderate an implied offence by a member to other members of the server where it is not in your jurisdiction to do so - i.e. if you have no server authority and attempt to moderate a player breaking a server rule. You are fully entitled to use the chat supplied by the program on our server to attempt to resolve disputes in private matters (including a community/organisation you belong to). We ask you, however, to refrain from unwillingly involving other members of our server in these by insisting you keep it to Private Messaging. We also would like to remind you we do not see private messages other than our own and thus cannot make decisions based on the content of those.</p>\n"
. "\t\t\t<p><b>2. No Bad Battle Behaviour:</b><br />\n"
. "\t\t\tNo raging at players who don't play by your personal rules. A player may use whatever Pokemon, moves, items, abilities that are allowed by the server and simulator - this extends to seemingly exploiting bugs/glitches. Blaming your opponent for 'hax' is also discouraged. If you feel you are unjustly treated by the RNG in a match where your opponent concludes with 'gg', please do not take it upon yourself to rage.</p>\n"
. "\t\t\t<p><b>3. No Excessive Bad Language:</b><br />\n"
. "\t\t\tNo excessive use of pejoratives, or words of a taboo or vulgar nature. A large proportion of people find these words hurtful; and the excessive use of them goes against our ideal of maintaining a comfortable to be on server.</p>\n"
. "\t\t\t<p><b>4. No Disrespectful Behavior:</b><br />\n"
. "\t\t\tNo overuse of putting members down, i.e. attacking their personal values. In certain circumstances, it may be acceptable to intentionally lower another member's ego, especially in a light-hearted situation. It may also feel a necessary course of action against those members who boast too much. We ask you to make a conscious effort, if you don't already, to try to treat everyone with respect and not discriminate against certain types of members: for example, new members. Also, no frequent impersonations of any member of the server.</p>\n"
. "\t\t\t<p><b>5. No Spamming:</b><br />\n"
. "\t\t\tNo excessive use of long, repeated or nonsensical messages. No excessive use of upper case letters (CAPS).</p>\n"
. "\t\t\t<p><b>6. No Flooding:</b><br />"
. "\t\t\tNo sending a high amount of messages in a short period of time, i.e. using up the server's resources carelessly and disrupting the main chat.</p>\n"
. "\t\t\t<p><b>7. No Flaming:</b><br />"
. "\t\t\tNo sending a destructively critical or abusive message, especially to provoke dissent or controversy.</p>\n"
. "\t\t\t<p><b>8. No Trolling:</b><br />"
. "\t\t\tNo intending to anger other members, create negative dramas, or otherwise disrupt the server's intended purpose. No exaggeration of the negative impacts of an auth's decision, or the behaviour of another member of the server.</p>\n"
. "\t\t\t<p><b>9. No Exaggerating Self-Importance</b><br />\n"
. "\t\t\tNo asking for authority. No excessive hinting over the fact you don't have authority. No frequent boasting.</p>\n"
. "\t\t\t<p><b>10. No Advertising:</b><br />\n"
. "\t\t\tNo sending hyperlinks into the main chat of other organisations main pages. You are allowed to send a hyperlink that links to specific content that can be a talking-point. However, no repeated sending of content from websites which are not extremely popular.</p>\n"
. "\t\t\t<p><b>11. No Malicious Links:</b><br />\n"
. "\t\t\tNo sending hyperlinks which link to potentially illegal material or that infect the receiver's PC. No sending hyperlinks which link to pornographic content, cause disgust or force one's internet browser window to remain open.</p>\n"
. "\t\t\t<p><b>12. No Language Inconsideration:</b><br />\n"
. "\t\t\tPokemon Perfect is primarily an English-speaking server - however, if the majority of the server is using a language that is not English, then they are perfectly entitled to do so.</p>\n"
. "\t\t\t<p><b>13. No Challenge Spamming:</b><br />\n"
. "\t\t\tNo repeated challenging of members of the server, especially if they refuse one or more times without you having gotten their battling approval.</p>\n";
